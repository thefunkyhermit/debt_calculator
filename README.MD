This is a Debt Service Calculator.  It uses AngularJS, Yeoman, and Twitter Bootstrap to allow users to enter their debts to calculate how long it will take to pay them all off.

Future enhancements will include monthly pay down schedules.  It will also prioritize payments based on interest rates to minimize debt service vs. principle payments.
